# Face Detection-Based Attendance System

This project is a face detection-based attendance system built using Python, OpenCV, and the `face_recognition` library. The system captures images from a webcam, detects faces, and marks attendance by saving the detected faces' names along with the time and date in a CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12.0
- OpenCV 4.8.0.76
- NumPy 1.24.3
- face_recognition 1.3.0
